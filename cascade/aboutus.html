            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>
                Rustic Sourdough is a family-owned bakery founded by a passionate mother and wife who loves the art of organic baking. Our bread is crafted using only the finest organic ingredients, with an emphasis on slow fermentation and a handmade process. Each loaf tells the story of our deep connection to the earth and the love we put into our work.

            <h3>Meet the Family Behind Rustic Sourdough</h3>
            <p>
                We're more than just a bakery. We're a family! Our story is built on a foundation of love, hard work, and a shared passion for baking. The bakery is led by a dedicated mother who juggles baking, caring for our one-year-old, and preparing for the arrival of our second child. Her husband, a college student, supports her in every way possible while balancing his academic life. Together, we create more than just sourdough—we create a legacy for our children, grounded in family values and a love for nature.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our love for the outdoors—whether it’s hiking in the hills or walking through local markets—has deeply influenced our baking. We value the simplicity of natural ingredients and the patience required to craft every loaf of bread. Our bakery is a reflection of our values: care, authenticity, sustainability, and a deep respect for nature.
